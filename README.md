### Getting Started:   
  What is Bitcoin, Blockchain and CryptoCurrenies?
  
  A blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that stores data  such as transactions, and that is publicly shared across all the nodes of its netowrk.
  Blocks are stored with Data and Hash and a hash from teh last block.
  
   A problem with trading in digial, how do you know the asset you have is original, has not been dublicated elsewere and is no longer in possetion by the one who gave it to you.  (The double spend problem).  Today we have trusted third parties to audit these transfactions and act as arbitors to step in if anything bad occures.  But what happens when these third parties become to big to fail and can not be trusted to act in your best interest. Enter the Bitcoin protcol where this ledger of transactions is shared with everyone.
   Digial assets on a blockchain act as physical assets in that they can be traced and identity confirmed thus elimitating the uncerttainty of counterfiting.
   
   What is money?
     U.S. dollars are not backed by anything other than the faith of the fools who accept it as payment and of other fools who agree in turn to accept it as payment from them. The main difference is that, for the moment at least, the illusion, in the case of dollars, is more widely and more fiercely believed.

### The History of Bitcoin:   

  Before the 1970s, cryptography was primarily practiced in secret by military or spy agencies. But, that changed when two publications brought it into the open: the US government publication of the Data Encryption Standard and the first publicly available work on public-key cryptography, “New Directions in Cryptography” by Dr Whitfield Diffie and Dr Martin Hellman.

  In the 1980s, Dr David Chaum wrote extensively on topics such as anonymous digital cash and pseudonymous reputation systems, which he described in his paper “Security without Identification: Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete”. 

  The Cypherpunks mailing list was formed at about the same time, and just a few months later, Eric Hughes published “A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto“.

  He wrote:

    “Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.”
